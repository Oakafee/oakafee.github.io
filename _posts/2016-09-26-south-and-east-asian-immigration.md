## South Asian

In recent decades there has been a huge amount of Indian immigration to NJ, and there are now a huge number of Indian-American New Jerseyites, spanning a variety of social classes. Some live in modest neighborhoods of Jersey City, near the Little India strip of stores and restaurants, and many of the residents of the Newport development in downtown JC seem to be Indian families. However, I think the bulk of the population is suburban, and many suburban NJ towns have sizable Indian populations, especially in Central Jersey. Edison has a whole downtown area that is pretty much ethnic Indian businesses. On a personal note, growing up in Millburn, I had some Indian-American friends.

Many Indian immigrants come with high levels of education and in-demand white collar job skills, allowing them to participate in the financial bonanza of corporate America and giving them access to some of the nicer suburbs of NJ. 

A good number of students at NJ's colleges are international students from India. 

## East Asian

Chinese immigration to NJ is massive, and seems to be largely a suburban phenomenon. If there are urban Chinese neighborhoods in NJ, then I've never seen them. However at this point, a sizable portion of kids from suburbs all over NJ are Chinese-American. Another personal note: many of my acquaintances growing up in Millburn were Chinese-American.

Edison apparently has a big Chinatown, though I've never seen it. Route 46 has a strip of Chinese (and Indian) restaurants and markets, anchored by an incredible noodle place: Shan Shan.

The amount of wealth arriving from China is substantial. Short Hills, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods you could probably find anywhere, is currently in the midst of a demographic shift towards Chinese immigrants. However, not all Chinese immigrants to NJ are wealthy. 

Many students at NJ's colleges are international students from China. 

Fort Lee is home to a substantial Korean community. Edgewater hosts a Japanese community, with a very impressive Japanese mall that attracts people from all over.
